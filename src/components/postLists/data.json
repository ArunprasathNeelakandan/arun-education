      "The Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). They also must choose between two concentrations: Health Sciences, and Biodiversity and Ecology. Upper-year B.Sc. students also have the opportunity to transfer into the Honours program in their final year if they meet certain requirements. The B.Sc. degree requires a strong grounding in the core sciences (math, physics, and chemistry). The B.Sc. is the best option if you intend to apply to graduate (M.Sc. or Ph.D.) or professional (e.g. medicine or physiotherapy) programs. Students with a strong interest in biology but not a strong grounding in the basic sciences thrive in the B.A. Biology program. The B.A is much more flexible than the B.Sc., and many students pair it with a second B.A. major. For example, a student interested in governmental health policy might choose a B.A. in Biology (Health Science) and a B.A. in Political Science, whereas an environmentally-oriented student might pair a B.A. Biology (Biodiversity and Ecology) with a B.A. in Environmental Studies."
